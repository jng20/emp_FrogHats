The Experiment:
Example arrays: 
array A : [ 1, 3, 5, 16, 26 ]
target = 26

LinTime, the number that counts how much time it takes to search, starts now. 
Immediately after Linear Search returns, time stops. 
The process is repeated for BinTime for Binary Search.

For the actual code, the array will have many many more elements and the experiment will be ran multiple times with randomized targets, all of which use the same array.

Additional Repetitions of the Experiment:
Each element in two separate arrays can store times for each individual experiment:

LinTimes : [ LinTime (for experiment 1), LinTime (for experiment 2)... ]
BinTimes : [ BinTime (for experiment 1), BinTime (for experiment 2)... ]

The faster search algorithm will ahve a lower average time for the arrays.

LinAvg = (LinTimes[0] + LinTimes[1]...) / LinTimes.length
BinAvg = (BinTimes[0] + BinTimes[1]...) / BinTimes.length

There may also be experiments with larger or smaller search arrays in order to see how much faster the search algorithms are in a wider range of arrays.
