#Test 1
* Binary search and linear search
** Both methods have instance variables start, end, timeTaken. They're all long variables.
** We basically copied and pasted our binary and linear search methods from hw 48
** The only change was that we take the time at the start and end of the methods
** timeTaken is just end minus start

*SearchDriver
** Created an integer array of size 999,999,999 and filled each index with values from 0 to 999,999,998 in order
** Created an int target that creates an integer from 0 to 999,999,998 inclusive
** Run binary search and linear search on the array while looking for the same target
