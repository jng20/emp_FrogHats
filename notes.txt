# Notes from test 1
* We might have to convert stuff to long for bigger sample size
* On the array of size 999,999,999, binary search found the target about 6 milliseconds faster on average
* Have to use System.currentTimeMillis();
* Should test when target is not in the array
* Should add a way to calculate average time of all the trials
* don't know any other test other than repeating this one
