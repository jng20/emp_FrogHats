# Notes from test 1
* We might have to convert stuff to long for bigger sample size
* On the array of size 999,999,999, binary search found the target about 6 milliseconds faster on average
* Have to use System.currentTimeMillis();
* Should test when target is not in the array
* Should add a way to calculate average time of all the trials
* don't know any other test other than repeating this one

#Notes from Update 1
* Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space when using Integer[999_999_999]

# Notes from Update 2
* Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayStoreException: java.lang.Integer
        at SearchDriver.main(SearchDriver.java:8)
* storing wrong type in the array
*Couldn't get long to work and don't know why
SearchDriver.java:8: error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from long to int
            bob[i] = (long)i;

# Notes from Update 3
#Binary and Linear Search
* commented out print statements
*NOW binSearch TAKES 0 TIME WTF
*LinSearch still takes the same time
* Do print statements make run time that much longer ???
